<h2>âœ¨ Hello thereâœ¨ </h2> 

I'm a Venezuelan illustrator and full stack software developer with a strong focus on front-end development and eager to enhance my back-end skills to deliver end to end solutions. 
Currently, I'm working on my portfolio while looking for new opportunities that allow me to leverage my skill set. I'm set and ready to take new challenges
